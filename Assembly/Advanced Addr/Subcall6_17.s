@Let's investigate calling a function.
@Deliverable 1: Run the program.  What are the values of R0, R1, and R2: Prior to calling myfunc; after executing the modify part of myfunc; returning from myfunc.	
@Deliverable 2: Rewrite the program using push and pop.  Only use one line for each to do this.  Show your program.  Show that your results are the same as before
@ prior to myfunc; after modify; return from myfunc.
